# Median Flash Video Player + Broadcaster

Unfortunately, Median still employs a Flash video player for streaming. This is due to HTML5 not quite yet being up to par on protecting video files without the use of extensions. Hopefully this will change someday. Due to the nature of Median's primary use by a college that needs to carefully protect its media assets, a Flash solution was the only way to go.

There are two main Flash files: the `m6_video_player.swf` file (the "video player", for both live and on-demand content), and the `M6LiveBroadcaster.swf` file (the "Median Live broadcaster").

The `m6_video_player.swf` needs to be loaded into Flash CS6 or Flash CC 2014, configured, and published for your use.

The `M6LiveBroadcaster.swf` needs to be loaded into Flash Builder 4.7, configured, and published for your use.
