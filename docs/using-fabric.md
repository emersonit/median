# Median Automation via Fabric

[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) is a great way to automate SSH commands across multiple servers, and it's great for automating continuous integration and basic service commands across the Median cluster.

There's commands like `update_webapp_code` which make the web app servers all pull the latest code.

Check out the Median Fabric automation repository for more info.
